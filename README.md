A collection of algorithms with use cases commonly used in bioinformatics.

1. Viterbi Algorithm : The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the most probable sequence of hidden states in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), given an observed sequence of events. It is commonly used in bioinformatics for tasks such as gene prediction, sequence alignment, and decoding biological sequences.
